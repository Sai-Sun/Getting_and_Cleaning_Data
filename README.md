Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
=========================
The file run_analysis.R is the script for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data. 

When to run the script, make some adjustments on the directory to make sure the data set would be read propoerly in your computer.

The output would be the tidy data set submitted in part 1 of the course project.
